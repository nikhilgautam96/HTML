    ```HTML
    <html>
        <head>

        </head>
        <body>
            All visible things are in body.
            <h1>Hello World!!</h1>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

-   Elements

    -   `opening tag + content + closing tag` = `element`.
    -   the tags tell the information about the content.
    -   eg :- `<b> Hello!! </b>`

-   Tags

    -   the opening and closing tags.
    -   every tag has certain meaning to it.
    -   eg :- `<b></b>` stands for bold.

-   Attributes

    -   They provide additional info about the contents of the elements.
    -   2 part : name & value. name = value
    -   `<a href="abc.com"> ABC </a>`

-   Semantic HTML

    -   In programming, Semantics = "meaning of a piece of code".
    -   eg:- `what effect does running that line of JS code have?` or `what purpose/role that HTML element have?` (rather that what does it look like).
    -   semantic HTML introduces meaning to the webpage rather that just presentation.
    -   eg :- `<p>` : it indicates enclosed text is paragraph. both semantic and presentational. people know what para are and browser know how to display them.

-   Why should you care about semantics?

    -   impacts SEO highly.
    -   It tells the browser the meaning of page and its content.
    -   It helps in communicating with search engines and client computers very well.
    -   eg :- If suppose we create a list using CSS and Div Element --> it might get displayed as list on page but there could be some keyboard features or something that won't come with it as in case of using an original list element.

-   Whatâ€™s the difference b/w `<b> and <strong>, <i> and <em>` ?

    -   `<b>` : is a style.
    -   `<strong>` : is a indication of how something should be understood.
    -   `<em>` : same as `<strong>` just adding more emphasis/attention to this element.
